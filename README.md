# Taking Uncertainty Seriously: Bayesian Marginal Structural Models for Causal Inference in Political Science

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

### Abstract

> While the past two decades have been characterized by considerable
> progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations
> where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or
> impossible, as is the case in much of political science, commonly
> employed approaches have developed largely within the frameworks of
> classical econometrics and frequentist non-parametric (Blackwell and
> Glynn 2018). Unfortunately, these frameworks are limited in their
> ability to answer many of the questions scholars of international
> relations and comparative politics are often interested in since they
> rely heavily upon the assumption of long-run replication rather than
> quantifying uncertainty directly (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020;
> Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). In this article we develop a
> Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models for
> causal inference with cross-sectional time series and panel data. We
> assess the proposed models’ performance relative to existing
> procedures in a simulation study and two empirical examples,
> demonstrating that our approach performs well in terms of recovering
> the true parameter values while also lending itself to a more direct
> and intuitive interpretation. To ensure accessibility, we provide a
> flexible implementation of the proposed model in the R package `brms`
> (Bürkner 2017, 2018).

### 🌸🤡🐟: Note on “carnation clownfish” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change. The seed `51684068` was
generated with random atmospheric noise at
[random.org](https://www.random.org/).

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = 51684068, type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "carnation clownfish"
```
